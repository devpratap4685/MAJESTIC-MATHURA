            <h2>Discover the Beauty of Vishram Ghat</h2>
            <p>Vishram Ghat is a sacred riverbank in Mathura where the holy river Yamuna meets the ocean. It is believed that taking a dip at Vishram Ghat during the auspicious time of the day, known as Brahma Muhurta, washes away all sins. The ghat is also known for its beautiful sunrise and sunset views, as well as the annual festival of Holi, which is celebrated here.</p>
